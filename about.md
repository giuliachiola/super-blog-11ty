I am Giulia,
a **front-end developer** from Italy.

I love writing documentation, read motivational quotes and cats 🐱

For these reasons, in this site you can find
- useful short tips about what I discover daily 📕[go to today i learned](/til)
- detailed articles about setup tools and projects 📘[go to blog](/blog)
- a motivational quote for each post, to keep your spirits high ✨
- lot of kitten photos in code examples  🐾

Right now, I am working for an italian agency, [Modo](https://modo.md/), where collegues and bosses teach me a lot every day... I feel so lucky to have them on my side!
