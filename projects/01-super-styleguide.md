The little design system to build this blog.
The DS has few components and less variants as possible, I developed just what I needed to build a simple blog like this! KISS (a.k.a. Keep It Simple Stupid!) üòá


| Use             | Tech stack                 |
|:----------------|:---------------------------|
| Presentation Layer | UIengine                        |
| Template engine | EJS                        |
| Content         | Javascript                 |
| Documentation   | Markdown                   |
| Repository      | Open source on [GitHub](#) |

## Project review, what I learned or improved

**Design**

I designed the pages on my own and the result is quite banal and impersonal. I reevaluated a lot the designers job!

**UIengine**

I used UIengine before in a _very big_ project, with lots of components and variants, and I loved it. Here in this little project I loved it even more!! üòç[UIengine](#) is very fast and easy to use, well done [Dennis ](#)! The only flaw I see is that UIengine unfortunately does not support _twig_ or _nunjucks_ template engines, which I think are the best template engines to use.

**EJS**

This was the first (and probably the last!) time I used _EJS_ as template engine. It was confortable to use JavaScript functions into the template, but I hate its terrible syntax with `<%=>` delimiters and for loops using functions. ü§¢

All things considered I liked build this styleguide, and I hope I will continue to add components!
