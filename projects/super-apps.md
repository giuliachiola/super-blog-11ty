While I work, often I come up with ideas for projects I could do, which could be useful to me to speed up development, could help others, or would be just funny to create 🙃 Unfortunately, during the week I have not much spare time, so I can't always work on ideas that come to me.

I have a personal list on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) of all projects I would like to do sooner or later. I post that list below, maybe it can be used as inspiration to someone who comes by 🙌🏻
