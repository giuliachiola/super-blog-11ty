We have to pay attention where we set nunjucks variables because they are **scoped**

{% raw %}
  ```twig
  {% for item in list %}
    {% set foo = item %}
  {% endfor %}

  {# foo is NOT available #}
  ```
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
  ```twig
  {% set foo = "" %}
  {% for item in list %}
      {% set foo = item %}
  {% endfor %}

  {# foo is available #}
  ```
{% endraw %}
